            "text": "I cannot rave enough about this little gem in Paris! First of all, the view of the Eiffel tower is magnificent and you can pretty much see it from every part of the apartment due to all the mirrors placed throughout. We loved laying in bed at night and watch the twinkling light show on the hour! Wow! The location is in a more residential part of Paris, so we really got a feel of local culture away from the tourist bustle, but we are still close enough to be apart of it if we wanted to. People watching from the apartment and from the balcony was great! Since we are in the city, there will be some street noise at night and during the day, but we found that authentic and charming. Metro stations are close by and a bus station right outside the apartment's main door made getting around very convenient. The neighborhood has small wine, cheese, pastry and food stores for easy shopping. The apartment was FULLY stocked! Marie and Charles are excellent hosts and communication was great. Each and every one of our concerns and questions throughout our planning process were addressed quickly and informatively. Although we didn't cook while we were there, you definitely could as the kitchen was fully equipped. Marie and Charles went above and beyond in stocking the apartment with so much essentials that made us feel right at home and we felt so worry free. Our week staying at the apt. really made us feel like we were living in Paris! We were sad to leave! The bathroom is updated and the shower is really awesome! The steam shower is a great way to end a day having been on our feet sight seeing and walking around the city. Unfortunately, we were not able to meet Marie in person, but we got to meet Charles. Such a pleasant and personable person and gave us lots of insight into his city and his insider tips to bakeries and shops. He even brought us croissants in the morning! I cannot stress how easy and wonderful our experience was as first timers in Paris! Marie & Charles love what they do and it shows! We hope to come back to Paris soon and we will definitely try to book this place again, if it is available. Thank you Marie & Charles! You have made our experience unforgettable! Merci Beaucoup!",

            "text": "Charles's apartment is truly fantastic. The obvious: the view really is that good. In fact, it's probably better than you think it is. There are enormous windows along the entire balcony, and there are mirrors throughout the apartment so that you can watch the Eiffel tower twinkle at night; there's a great view of the grand palais and the sacre coeur off the balcony as well. It's a breathtaking view when its cloudy, rainy, sunny or nighttime. The apartment facilities are also quite lovely. Everything was clean and in working order. The kitchen has a nice induction range that is great for cooking eggs, and a nespresso machine. The fridge is spacious. There is a dishwasher, washing machine and dryer that helped us save time and packing space. The shower is fantastic, with good water pressure; it has handheld, rainfall and waterfall shower heads as well as a built in steam shower. The bed is comfortable and the common areas are very open feeling. There is a (small) elevator that efficiently takes you up to the eighth floor, and there are key-fob activated security gates at every entrance to the building. The location is also great for a visitor to Paris. You are right on the border of the 7th arr (highly touristy with the Eiffel Tower, Rodin museum and Napoleon's tomb) and the 15th arr (much more residential, with great fromageries, boulangeries and a fantastic farmers market twice a week). It is a short walk to the metro stops at Champ de Mars, Bir Hakeim and La Motte-Picquette-Grenelle. There are also many useful (and scenic) bus lines that leave right below the apartment's balcony (including the #69 which makes an excellent self-guided bus tour--see Rick Steves's Paris book). Marie (Charles's mom) was a lovely host, and she and her husband spent a lot of time helping us get settled and checked in with us every few days to make sure things were going well. All in all we couldn't recommend our stay at Charles's apartment more highly.",

Not only did it exceed our expectations but the graciousness of Marie, Pierre and Charles was far beyond what we expected. From the first time I contacted Marie to inquire about the property to the night before we left she made every effort to provide information regularly and to check in to inquire of our plans (that way she could offer suggestions if needed--car service, suggestions for sights to see, restaurant suggestion, answering questions not only about the property but also responding to requests such as for help for the best way to go to see the Tour de France (yes, we were lucky enough to be in town at the end of it!) and helping us plan for our son to travel from Paris the day we arrived to Tigne France where it was another 3 1/2 hour train ride and a three hour shuttle ride to get there. All within 1 hour of arriving from the USA. We were lucky enough to meet Charles who was in town for business (and who is every bit as lovely as his parents!) He contacted us the evening prior to arrival to make sure everything would flow smoothly and he was waiting outside the flat when we arrived. He then gave us a quick tour and demonstrated how everything in the flat worked and then helped us call a cab to take our son to Gar de Lyon as we were on a super tight schedule. Upon arriving back at the flat we had a more leisurely chance to enjoy the view, all the lovely amenities and the treats left (macaroons and champagne) as well as being grateful for the basics left in the fridge. Milk, beer, water, coke, etc. Our favorite things about the flat..the view, the view, the view. As if you could touch the Tour Eiffel. Enjoyed it in the morning drinking coffee on the lovely outdoor patio (espresso maker and plenty of pods in the flat!), and loving it as the sun set and at night when she twinkled. The steam shower! Having a spa experience every day in your own home for free. Heaven! And the pictures for the bath do NOT do it justice. The comfortable bed and EVERY amenity you could need or forgot to bring there for you. What I have not liked about some of our past Airbnb experiences was that they left barely any toilet paper, one bar of soap, no paper towels or laundry soap etc. Marie had EVERYTHING stocked with plenty for the duration of our stay as well as extra in the vanity (perfume, bandaids, lotion, lovely body wash and shampoo in the shower) etc. It was if you were staying somewhere where they really liked or loved you and they wanted to make sure you had absolutely everything you could want...Merci beacoup, dieu tu benisse dear Charles family!",

It was great seeing all the Paris guide books from different authors, along with maps and other city information right there to thumb through. Even though we had done plenty of research before coming, it was great to have additional information. -The view and the balcony. Let's be real: that view is what all of our Paris dreams are made of. And with the huge balcony and unobstructed view, it really doesn't get any better. -The bathroom. Words cannot describe how AMAZING this bathroom is. That steam shower. Oh my gosh. Just the best. We used it every single day of our trip. Coming back after a day running around, especially if it had been damp and dreary, this was like a slice of heaven. And with all the wonderful rain and waterfall shower heads. I'm telling you, it was like a spa and worth every penny of the rental fee. Additionally, the apartment is in a really nice area and is generally pretty quite after dark, which we enjoyed. The Champ de Mars RER and the Bir-Hakeim Metro stops were both a little more than five minutes walk away and really did connect you to anything in the city. We found all the appliances we used, including the washer, dryer, oven, Nespresso and microwave all worked and were great to have on hand.

If Airbnb has an award for hosts (and I believe they do) they shouldn't just give it to Marie and Pierre, they should name the award in their honor. The apartment is in the best location in Paris. We were in Paris for eight days and we went everywhere in the city, and I can say with certainty there is no better location. Just a few steps from the front door is a bakery, fruit stand, groceries, butcher shop, cheese shop and restaurants. The two best bus lines (42, 69) are right out the front door and the most convenient metro station in Paris is a few minutes away. On Sunday I walked to the Louvre, Orsay and Notre Dame along the Seine River, which is just a ten minute walk from the apartment. And finally there is the Eiffel Tower, which you can almost reach out and touch from every room in the apartment. The apartment itself is perfect . Look at the photos in the listing, which are amazing, then realize when you arrive the apartment will exceed your expectations in every way. Spending time in Paris in this apartment with Marie and Pierre as your hosts is the experience of a lifetime.",

Marie, as others have mentioned, was perfection -- charming and thoughtful. She let us know months in advance to get our Eiffel Tower ticket to avoid the long lines and provided early information on museum passes. She clearly thinks on her feet. I left her contact information with a store manager forgetting to tell her she might be called. Marie understood the situation and resolved it for us. I now have a fabulous dress for my son's wedding. We loved it that Marie uses technology. We communicated by text! P.s. The apartment has a new state of the art bathroom. Absolutely gorgeous.

From the spectacular view to the well-equipped kitchen; from the welcoming gestures to the kind and knowledgeable help we received from Marie, Charles' mother; from the comfortable bed to the gloriously imagined bathroom, the apartment was practically a destination in itself. There are very few Paris apartments that sport a 40 foot balcony, loads of light (and complete darkness when you want it), mirrors that accentuate and reflect the grand vistas this place affords some nine stories up and a location that is second to none. My wife and I love to rent apartments instead of hotel rooms, and this place is a perfect example of why it makes sense.",

The apartment was well furnished and had the amazing views of the Eiffel Tower. It was very well equipped and stocked like a home with plenty of crockery, cutlery, utensils, linen etc, even with non perishable foodstuffs in the kitchen. A nice touch to have macaroons, champagne and a giant vase of flowers welcoming us. Access to the apartment was easy and felt secure. The rental was not cheap but still represented good value for money. We very much enjoyed quiet use of the apartment.

            "text": "This was our first trip to Paris and was to celebrate our 40th wedding anniversary. We wanted the trip to be extra special and memorable. We also decided that we wanted to spent our two weeks exploring Paris and experiencing a little slice of Parisienne life rather than running ourselves ragged like many a tourist. We fell in love with Charles' apartment from the moment we first discovered it on Airbnb. Without exception, the apartment was as pictured and as promised. The way that Charles' mother Marie and father Pierre attended to our needs was truly extraordinary. They made us feel like we were a part of the family! What can we say about the amazing view of the Eiffel Tower? Equally as impressive was the \"Central Park-like\" view of looking over the park called Champs de Mars, the distant view of the Basilica Sacre' Coure on Montmartre and the expansive view of the north and western portions of the city. There are plenty of great places to eat in the neighborhood, an amazing cheese shop just around the corner and a very nice wine shop too. Local markets are close by, making it convenient to stock up for a home cooked meal or several. The apartment is perfectly suited for walkers like us. We logged 10-15 miles per day exploring most parts of the city from our \"home\" base. While we did not travel by bus, you could catch a bus to anywhere just by stepping out the door. A Metro station, which we did use a few times, is a short 5 minute walk down the street. At first we were concerned that the apartment would be very noisy at night but with the sliding windows and curtains closed, it was not noisy at all. It helped that the bedroom and living room have air conditioning, especially since it was quite warm the two weeks we were there. In a nutshell, we highly recommend this great apartment and especially appreciate the gracious hospitality shown to us by Marie and Pierre.",

Every morning when I woke up, I looked outside to see if the Eiffel Tower was still there or if it had only been a dream...and every morning, it was still there, every bit as impressive as the first time we saw it off the terrace with Marie and Pierre at sunrise that first morning. They were such gracious hosts! And the apartment had everything we needed and more. We loved the proximity to the busses, subway, restaurants and many stores. But I think that what we enjoyed the most was being so close to the Tower, so that every night after dinner, we mixed with the crowd, watched the locals just laying on the lawn of the Champs de Mars, with a bottle of wine, enjoying the art if doing nothing... We were in an elegant neighborhood and felt very safe even after dark. If you are reading this review trying to decide if you should rent Charles' place, by all means do it if you are lucky enough to have the opportunity. You will enjoy coming \"home\" to it at the end of every day as we did and will not regret your decision. And you will have two new friends in Marie and Pierre that were always SO willing to help us. If we ever go back to Paris, that will be our home away from home again, no doubt!!!",

We were met at the apartment by our very gracious hosts Marie and her husband who could not do enough for us. The apartment provided us with everything we needed for our stay and more. The luxury of getting up,making our own breakfast and enjoying it on the balcony in full view of the Eiffel Tower (all in the comfort of our PJ's) was fabulous.

We stayed for a week in Charles's apartment in July 2014 and it was a very special experience and one which we will always remember with joy. The apartment is exactly as advertised with a literally breathtaking view. The view was in fact our main reason for staying at the apartment and we had previously considered 5-star hotels in Paris which boast a similar view. It was my 40th birthday while in Paris and I wanted a memorable view with which to begin and end each day. We booked Charles's apartment as a very affordable way to have this view and we were not disappointed. If this is something that is important to you also, then go ahead and stay here because it is awe-inspiring. The apartment is situated in what feels like a very safe quartier of Paris and of course exceptionally close to the Eiffel Tower (perhaps a 3 minute walk). There are many shops and amenities close by, however we did find that a few had closed down for the summer but this is to be expected. We discovered an absolute gem in the restaurant Casse Noix and wish we had had the opportunity to eat here more often! We have no hesitation in recommending this restaurant which is situated a 2 minute walk from the rear exit of the apartment building. The apartment itself is lovingly maintained by Charles's gracious mother Marie and her attention to detail is evident in every room of the apartment. The bed was clean and comfortable, an essential to any stay away from home! Having a washing machine and fridge was very convenient and they were new and clean. Marie had left champagne and macarons for us on our arrival which is so kind and very thoughtful. Which brings me to the real benefit of staying at this apartment; Marie and Pierre. You cannot overestimate the value of having such generous and welcoming hosts on arrival to a foreign country, and both Marie and Pierre made us feel as if we were treasured and most welcome guests in their home. Their kindness will always remain as one of our favourite memories of Paris. À bientôt Paris!",

            "text": "I and my bf just returned yesterday from Paris after an 8 day stay at Charles' lovely apt. directly by the Champs de Mars and Eiffel Tower. Naturally, we immediately took notice of the spectacular view from the terrace, and also the tremendous comfort of the bedroom mattress! We slept beautifully. It was a treat seeing the iconic Eiffel Tower lit up every night from the apt. window. The apartment is both cozy and stylish, and fully stocked with amenities; towels, blankets, umbrellas, dishes, cookware, toiletries, universal adaptors for your electronics, and even basic foods such as coffee, jams, water and sundry condiments! The kitchen comes complete with a dishwasher and washer/dryer. There is plenty of hot water for showering. Charles' parents were very accommodating and generous. They welcomed us with flowers champagne and delicious fresh macaroons, and made sure our taxi for the airport was set when we had to depart. There are plenty of maps and travel books available, and personal suggestions from Charles and his parents as to where to dine, etc. The free wi-fi also enabled us to use our laptop and have easy access to any info. we were seeking. The 7th arrondissement is an elegant and wonderful place to stay. It is quite safe, residential, and very convenient. It reminded us of Recoleta in Buenos Aries. There are wonderful boulangeries, frommageries, wine shops, brasseries, and upscale restaurants within walking distance. The post office, ATM's, metros and buses are also in walking distance, if not directly in front of the residence. Just pick up a carnet of 10 tickets and you're set to go. Take the 69 bus across the street to see the major sites and to go directly to the beautiful Pere Lachaise cemetery to Gambetta (last stop). You can take the nearby metro/line 6 at the Bir-Hakeim station (towards Nation) or the 8/10 line @ La Motte-Picquet – Grenelle and change for the 12 line @ to Montmartre. Be sure to check out Espace Dali in Montmartre (11 rue Poulbot)! Restaurants in the area we loved: Mariette on 24 rue Bosquet, Au Petit Sud Ouest (unbelievable duck and fried foie gras!) on 46 avenue Bourdonnais, Le P'tit Troquet on 28 rue Exposition. and Vin et Maree right on Suffren for delicious seafood. Overall- this apt and location. is a safe bet on all accounts and highly recommended if you are visiting Paris.",

From the outset Marie's emails and directions were outstanding and to finally meet her was an honour. She gave us a complete orientation of the apartment and left us with a plate of macarons and a bottle of champagne which coupled with the awesome view set the scene for an amazing week in Charles' apartment. The apartment is beautifully laid out, the beds are very comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need to cook some great meals. When you stay in the apartment you don't feel like you are staying in someone else's home. It definitely feels like a 5 star hotel with beautiful linen, plenty of beautiful towels and of course Marie's wonderful tips and advice, better than any concierge I have ever met. I would have no hesitation in recommending Charles' apartment to anyone who enjoys and appreciates quality. After being away for a month and then to finish up with a week in Paris in Charles' apartment was pure bliss, and I am envious of all who stay there. We are already starting to plan for our next visit, To experience Paris from so close to the Eiffel Tower and to see that sparkling light show every evening was simply breathtaking. Coupled with Marie and Charles' ( though we did not meet Charles) eye for detail and concern that their guests have a great holiday, this was surely the highlight of a wonderful trip.",

There are numerous restaurants and bakeries nearby too. And THE VIEW of the Eiffel Tower.... It's stupendous!!! The iconic steel frame is just literally a few steps outside your front door. It's so mesmerizing especially at night that you just want to rush back by 6 everyday just so you can stare at it all night. But what makes this place even more special is MARIE (Charles's mom). She will probably be one of the loveliest person you will ever meet. She will tell you where the good restaurants are and explain which buses go where. She even wanted to help us with our luggage!!? She is SO warm and you can almost feel her positive energy rubbing off on you (exactly what you need to start your vacation!) It was certainly a privilege to have met her. Merci Beaucoup Marie!!",

Marie is both! She is one of the most caring people I have met. The view is unbelievably breathtaking. No better location in the city. The bed is very comfortable. There is a full kitchen with all the amenities you could ask for, even a breadbox! The heater works very well and can make the apartment very warm. The entrance has a security gate and security door to building. There is also a security camera above your apartment door and night watchmen, so you feel safe. The apartment has two umbrellas. There are two comfy and very warm robes, even two pairs of slippers (I wear size 10.5 USA, they were an inch short for me). There were too many amenities to list them all but a few of them were; shampoo, conditioner, body wash, hand lotion, hairdryer, big box of Kleenex for apartment, two small travel packs of Kleenex to carry while sightseeing, The only downside. It's an old building. Marie, in her caring and considerate nature, lets you know that the neighbor next door can hear you if you're loud or slam the front door, and that the neighbor below hears you if you wear shoes at night (wooden floors). Marie is a wonderful landlord, who tries to make sure her neighbors aren't bothered by renters. She goes out of her way to caution you, so I hope none of her neighbors bug her about renters, because there is another side to the story: the noise goes both ways. In the bedroom at 7:30pm, you hear voices (tv or people) from a neighboring apartment. When you're in bedroom and a neighbor slides open their wooden closet door or moves a chair along the wooden floor (we couldn't tell which), you hear it as if it was in the next room. Neighbor noise began around 630pm (home from work?) and we heard things until a little after 8pm. We fell asleep at 9pm and noise was never a problem at night (the residents seem to know it's a noisy building, and they all agree to be quiet). At least one neighbor has Marie's phone number, if not all of them, so you will want to be quiet because you will love Marie so much after meeting her that you won't want her to be bothered by complaining neighbors. One person/teenager on the extra cot would be fine, but two would probably be uncomfortable. However, the couch is gigantic and very comfortable. The couch would be a great sleeping alternative and has a great view of the Eiffel Tower. For food, Monoprix is an easy walk, probably 5mins, and they have everything you need. Franprix is more of a corner convenience store and is almost next door. There are plenty of restaurants in the area both near the...",

We checked out dozens of ads from different websites, and we felt comfortable in dealing with AirBnB because of its policies. Of the few apartments that came as our \"finalists\", Charles' unit met most of our basic criteria : a SHORT walk to the Eiffel Tower, bakeries, restaurants, and groceries/markets. The reviews of those who have stayed in this apartment are as accurate as can be, so I will no longer touch on this. But we tip our hats to Marie and Pierre, Charles' parents whom we have personally met a few times, for the superb care that they have given us. One of the reviewers have precisely described them as our \"guardian angels in Paris\". We have found our \"home\" in Paris, and looking forward to our 2014 visit. LOVE IT !! Really a five star! \"",

The photos of the apartment say it all - the views of the Eiffel Tower are breathtaking, especially at night when the lights \"twinkle\". Everything we needed for our stay was within walking distance - bakery, pastry shop, cheese shop, wine shop, small grocery store and of course and abundance of cafes and restaurants. Public transportation was also very convenient - the buses ran right in front of the building and there was a metro station just 7 minutes away.

From the first contact with them we were warmly welcomed and given all the information we could possibly need. Marie, who welcomes you to the apartment, kindly waited three hours for us to arrive as our plane was late. She is an incredibly genuine and friendly person and her concern for our well-being was like that of a friend. I was travelling with my 15 year old son but with no other adults and I felt that I could call on Marie for assistance and advice. The area around the apartment is residential and feels completely safe. There are all the shops you could need in the street including chemists, small supermarkets, bakeries and restaurants within a short walk as well as parks and transport. Buses leave from right outside the door and it is only a short walk to the RER or Metro. There is wonderful shopping in nearby areas. The apartment itself is exactly as described - the view is incredible and the apartment has lovely antique and modern furniture and a great kitchen. It has everything you could need including washing machine and dryer, an iron and all cooking needs. There is only one thing to consider which is that being a residential apartment block it is very important to consider your neighbours who are probably going to work while you are on holiday and this apartment would not be suited to people who would want to be very noisy late at night. Otherwise it is a wonderful opportunity to experience living like a Parisian. Highly recommended!",

            "text": "There have been 54 excellent reviews that speak for itself. However, after staying in Charles' apartment for 15 days, we can attest that the in-person treatment and experience have been even more phenomenal. The apartment itself is located in a very desirable area because of its convenience and proximity to all modes of transportation necessary to get around Paris as well as day trips outside of Paris. The cleanliness of the apartment is par to a 5 star hotel plus the additional amenities such as the washer dryer, a heated table on the balcony, and the undeniable space that makes your stay much more comfortable. The views are what first initially attracted us to this apartment -- they are even more magical in person and seen from every part of the apartment. But having shared all that from a slightly obsessive and germaphobic couple, you're only skimming the surface of what this apartment can offer. The true value of this place lies behind the family who runs it and the integrity behind each of them. Charles, from the very beginning, has instantly welcomed us first as a guest, and second as a renter. His responsiveness is very respectable and his sheer generosity admirable. He is a genuine person. Pierre is Charles' brilliant father who is a doctor you can call should you need anything medical. This alone brings peace of mind. The heart of this apartment continues with Charles' amazing mother, Marie. You will instantly gravitate towards her warmth, sincerity and irresistible pleasantness. She is the most gracious and knowledgeable hostess, who is also your personal concierge, your good friend, your local insider, and your proud crusader who makes herself tirelessly available to ensure all your needs are met. She is invaluable. This apartment under-promises and over-delivers on all counts: location, views, service and overall experience. They embrace the fact that not every guest gets many chances to go to Paris, so they fight hard to make sure you get an unforgettable experience and the most value that go beyond the actual currency paid. If you're a perfectionist with a distinct eye for those who go the extra mile for your time, money, and loved ones, it would be a mistake to not grab this place if you find an opening on their calendar. Needless to say we were more than impressed. We are very selective on our recommendations to others and this place ranks high on our list. After two wonderful weeks of twinkling lights, we are not staying anywhere else in Paris that does not involve Charles, Pierre and Marie. We still fondly talk about them till this day!",

Marie is a most welcoming and helpful host and we felt like we were visiting relatives. We had all that we needed and much more. Home made cakes and Champange on arrival were delicous and appreciated by all of us. The apartment has the most amazing view. It was our first time in Paris and being able to soak in the Eiffel Tower all times of the day and night was unforgetable. It was breathtaking and so exciting for the children-7 and 11 years- waiting with anticipation and then marvelling at the hourly 10minute extra sparkly light shows from 9pm (thanks for the special remote Charles ; xx)) The neighboorhood was great for us too. Within a block was all the Parisian speciality food shops we could have hoped for. We got very accustomed to popping downstairs to pick up pain au chocolat for breakfast and bagettes for our lunch. Marie and Charles gave us lots of information about getting around Paris. The buses are right out front of the apartment and became our favourite mode of transport. Thanks again for Marie's advice about getting the ticket books that were valid for the metro too which we also used a couple of times. The apartment was big enough for our family and was clean with plenty of extras like beautiful toilettries and fluffy white towels as well as robes. As our stay came to an end Marie responded again to our request for help and recommended a great restaurant within a near neighbourhood filled with locals. We enjoyed fabulous escargot and duck and soaked in the atsmosphere of Paris both at the restaurant and on the walk home. Thanks to Marie our last night was spot on and concluded with our last Eiffel Tower light show, for this trip anyway. We wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Paris and as a previous reviewer said the only downside was leaving. Thankyou again Marie and Charles for a just perfect stay in our Parisian home for a week.",

She is so lovely and explained all the details we needed to know about the apartment, the surrounding area (bakeries, restaurants, etc.), and the transportation options. She left us her phone number and email and was in constant contact whenever we needed her. The location is magnificent, where else can you see such an incredible view of the Eiffel Tower from your bed without having to pay exorbitant hotel rates? The apartment was stocked with everything we needed and we were welcomed with champagne and macaroons! There were plenty of towels, cleaning supplies, spices, condiments. There were maps and books and binders full of area sites, restaurant and sightseeing recommendations and how best to make our way around the city. The apartment is secure, in a great neighborhood, and close to bus, metro, and RER stops so it's easy to get anywhere in the city from here. Eating on the balcony or the breakfast nook almost in the shadow of the Eiffel Tower was like something out of a dream! If you're heading to Paris, do yourself a favor and stay at this incredible apartment - you won't be disappointed!!",

Best of all was the location: the Eiffel Tower view is the best anywhere - even locals told us how lucky we were! The balcony is great for photos, especially during the nightly light show. Also, lots of shops and restaurants are right downstairs, making it easy to grab a quick pain au chocolat for breakfast, or an easy dinner before heading home for the night. Finally, Marie made sure we had many special touches to greet us: a Christmas tree, chocolates for our kids, and champagne for New Year's Eve.

Charles' mother, Marie, was warm, friendly, and helpful on arrival, providing lots of useful advice on the neighbourhood. This was my first time using airbnb, and both she and Charles made it very easy. The apartment itself is very comfortable and matches if not exceeds the photos. It's surprisingly quiet at night, and well served by a bakery, bottle shop (wine store/negociant), cheese shop, greengrocer, and two convenience stores, all within 50m. There's plenty of restaurants nearby. It's close to the RER (overland) and two metro stations, though the best bet to get into the centre of Paris with minimal line changes is La Motte-Picquet - Grenelle, about a five minute walk away. To cut a long story short, I couldn't recommend this apartment highly enough. It's extremely comfortable, perfectly located, has a great view, and friendly hosts. Merci, Charles and Marie.",

The apartment has an incredible view of the Eiffel Tower and is only a 4 minute walk from the apartment. The apartment is fitted with all of the amenities needed for a comfortable stay. With two small children we felt safe in the quaint neighborhood and secure with the gated entry at the front of the building. We had easy access to parks & playgrounds as well as convenient transportation to all the major sites around the city. Near the apartment there are several great restaurants, a market for fresh fruit and a nice bakery. The only negative we encountered was with parking. During the weekend, street parking is free, however, during the week public parking is nearby but a bit pricey (30/euro per 24 hrs). We would highly recommend this apartment for your stay in Paris and look forward to staying here again in the future.",

They truly just want people to enjoy the apartment and spectacular views - they are a real treasure! The location is just amazing with a view from the bedroom, lounge room and kitchen like in the photos. The photos really do not do it justice it is so much more, especially at night when the light show happens on the hour every hour - breathtaking view. There is even a heated table on the balcony so you can keep warm at night watching the light show or having breakfast. The apartment itself is just immaculate with lovely leather furniture, timber floors and crisp white linen and towels and has a washing machine and clothes dryer which was great. Everything is supplied in the apartment including dishwasher & Laundry powder, tea coffee sugar even cooking oils to name a few. We highly recommend staying in Charles' apartment. From our first contact we knew we made the right decision as this was the first time we had used AIRBNB. Charles kept in contact and then just before we left Australia we were in contact with Marie his mother who looks after the apartment for him, and confirmed she was expecting us and gave us advice on how to get to the apartment. I would have to say you are unlikely to get a better location in Paris as it is literally opposite the park that leads up to the Eiffel tower at an intersection with unobstructed views. We will definitely be returning to Paris and will book Charles' apartment again.",

We have absolutely no complaints as everything was above and beyond our wildest expectations. Thanks Charles for the amazing apartment and whenever we go back to Paris this is wear we will stay. We are also recommending this apartment to all of our friends and family.",

            "text": "Beautiful apartment that fit my family (2 adult and 2 child) perfectly, situated in a very secure building with lift. It is very easy to find; facing Champs De Mars with the Eiffel Tower to the left. Fantastic shops all around with many supermarkets along your way to the RER which was just 5 mins away. Bus stop is just in front of the building too. Apartment was very clean with all the appliance working fine. We made use of the very new fridge, washing machine, dryer and dish washer throughout our stay without any glitches. All necessary washing liquid / detergent was also available. Strong wifi allows us to plan our itinerary when we were there and the heater kept us warm and toasty in the cold December. As Charles was away, we were greeted by his mom, Marie, a very nice and helpful lady. Communication with her, via email, went very well before we arrive and even while we were there. She recommended a good shop for us to buy a new luggage and help obtain information on transfer cost to Disneyland. Oh, did we mention the view? The eiffel tower was the last thing we see everytime we go to bed during our stay. The huge mirror in the living area, where our children slept on the comfy sofa bed, allowed them to share the same experience. We enjoyed having breakfast in the kitchen with the tower looking down on us. Excellent stay! Will definitely come back! Highly recommended!",

This was my first time using this site and I feel so blessed to have found such an incredible place with such trustworthy hosts. There are so many apartments listed for Paris, but they are apartments you can find anywhere in the world. The spectacular view and wonderful facilities of this apartment ensures that you always remember that you are in the stunning Paris. You don't want to miss any opportunity to have to stay here - I promise you, you won't regret it! Memories for a lifetime.",

Both Charles and his mother were very attentive and went out of their way to make sure we were comfortable. The apartment is great. Its in a modern building, and has a large elevator (for Paris). Kitchen is ample and well equipped. The bathroom has an American style shower with curtain (not the French style open tub/shower). My brother (6'4\") slept in the convertible sofa comfortably. Location is also very convenient. There is a small supermarket one block away, and very good restaurants in the area. Several bus lines pass through the Champ de Mars, and three metro stations are very close by. Definitely recommended.",

Since the building is right on the Champ de Mars, you can gaze all the way across the city to Sacre Coeur and the Eiffel Tower is right outside your window (we loved watching it sparkle at night as we lay in bed or relaxed on the balcony). Marie, Charles’s mother, met us when we arrived and she could not have been more kind, she also checked in with us throughout the week to see how we were doing and if we needed anything. There are many dining options in the area and easy access to the RER, Metro, and buses to get you anywhere in the city you’d like to go. We could not recommend this apartment more highly. Thank you, Charles and Marie for an amazing stay in Paris!",

            "text": "It was a pleasure getting to use Charles’ apartment during our week in Paris. We were two couples from Oregon visiting Paris for a few days this fall. The location of the apartment was ideal, with easy access to the metro, buses, restaurants, shops and a very short walk from the Eiffel Tower. While Charles was traveling on business, his mother Marie was there to receive us. She quickly showed us around the apartment as well as had picked up a few things we needed in advance of our arrival. The apartment has all of the conveniences one needs for a good visit to Paris. A well-furnished kitchen, laundry, utensils and very clean linens. Charles had left lots of instructions and information on things to do and how to get around. The elevator turned the 9th. floor into a great advantage with no drawbacks. The view was magnificent and so were the people we rented from. Marie was always accessible and willing to help. Even in the last day, when we weren’t able to get a taxi, she was kind enough to call and book one for us. This will definitely be where we’ll stay during our next visit to Paris.",

Famed Bus 69 begins its scenic route practically at our doorstep, and delivered us to many popular destinations while enjoying the city sights above ground. We'll return soon! Thanks Charles!",

            "text": "Wow!!! The description for Charles' apt was totally accurate. It was exceptional and the view was even more stunning than the pictures. My fiancé and I went to Paris to celebrate our engagement and this was the perfect space for a week in the city. The apartment is just over a block away from the Eiffel Tower. The metro was less than a five minute walk and the residential area was full of dinning options. The building is not much to look at from the outside, but was clean, safe, and quiet. The only thing better than the location and aesthetics of the apartment was Charles as the owner. He went above and beyond to make our stay fantastic. The aptment was clean, all the linens were new, and were greeted by fresh flowers and wine. Between Charles and his very charming mother, any need we had (which were few) was attended to promptly and in a spirit of hospitality. The next time we are in Paris we know where we will stay. You can't go wrong staying here.",
