He had welcome drinks and jellies in the fridge for us which was a added and welcoming surprise. He also delivered us breakfast our first morning with fresh pastries from the bakery just outside the apartment. The bed was comfortable and I enjoyed having fluffy pillows unlike the flat brick-like pillows we had at our hotel in London. The location couldn't have been better for us. Super close to two metro stations and the street the apartment is on had everything we needed; a bakery, cheese shop, grocery store, rotisserie stands, wine store and a beer store. We were very thankful for this as we were able to pick up food for dinner instead of eating out every night.

The owner provides bed linen and towels of good quality. Convenient balshoy bed. Wi Fi good speed. Near the apartment many nice shops and cafes (store cheese, meat, vegetables and fruit, wine). Subway line 7 1 minute from the apartment. Near two train stations North and East, which is very convenient. George is always ready to help if you need anything! On the first day, guests receive a Breakfast of French croissants (unforgettable) and a bottle of wine. For me when renting an apartment is very important to the security of the area. And it's really quiet and safe area! We spent a magical week in Paris visiting George! Stay in Paris in this French house for little money! Definitely recommend!!!

The studio is small but very efficient and well-appointed with absolutely everything we needed during our stay - dishes, microwave, coffee maker, tea pot, ironing board, even a laundry basin and detergent. It was clean and cozy, and the Murphy bed was surprisingly comfortable. We wanted a place that was away from the really touristy areas, and wanted to \"live like locals,\" and this area was exactly that. The flat is situated close to Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est, and also convenient to several Metro stations, so it's easy to get around the city, if you're comfortable with using public transit. The usual sites like the Eiffel Tower and Notre Dame are only about 20 minutes away, and the Metro only costs 14,10€ for a 10-pack of tickets. The neighborhood is full of patisseries, boulangeries, fromageries, and small markets where you can pick up provisions for meals in the flat, or for picnics on the Canal Saint-Martin. It was more of a real Parisian experience than staying in a hotel in the tourist district. We loved every minute and would stay here again on our next trip to Paris.",

The street is very happening location, full of restaurants bakeries and many more shops. One can feel the buzz of life even during late evening hours. We were given the studio in an extremely neat and clean condition. It has all facilities even for cooking an eating. Georges is a very nice host. He replied promptly all of my queries almost immediately and provided me a nice guideline to reach his place. He personally looks after the comfort of his guest. He left for us some welcome drinks in the fridge and treated us with nice croissant breads in the next morning. Geroges took care to provide a small bed in addition for my little baby.

Georges wasn't there to greet us on arrival but he organised for his neighbour Helene to meet us at the apartment. She was charming and ran through everything we needed to know. Georges communication from the first enquiry to the end of our stay was impeccable. The studio was small but perfectly formed. I wanted to stay somewhere close to Canal St Martin and this was an ideal location as it was also walking distance from our arrival station of Gare du Nord and Gare de l'Est was a stones throw with great Metro connections there. The Studio was clean and well maintained with lovely bed linen and the supplies of coffee, loose leaf tea and cold beverages, not to mention the delivery of croissants on our first morning were lovely and thoughtful touches. The boulangerie just a couple of doors down is superb! We stayed a total of four nights and were thrilled to come home to the studio each night after a days adventuring. The studio is set in a private courtyard so is peaceful and secure too. Georges lives below so was on hand had we had any problems. When we got to meet him, he was so kind and apologised about the weather but we really had a marvellous time. He was also very gracious after my accident washing up on our last morning when I broke a plate. I felt awful but he was kind about that too. Would absolutely recommend to anyone wanting a peaceful place to stay with a host that cares and wishes to offer an authentic stay with great tips on where to shop and eat. The location is brilliant for anyone at all and especially those travelling by Eurostar to Gare du Nord",

Unfortunately, there was one day that I had a real problem with. There was work scheduled to be done in the apartment that I was unaware of. On this day in particular, I had really bad back pains and did not leave the apartment until later in the afternoon. Georges came up to the room with the service man and said that he needed to get in and I felt like I had no option but to let them in. I was lying in bed for about two hours in pain while the service man did his work. I was completely exposed, this is a small studio so it’s not like I could go into another room and we didn’t have to see each other. I feel as if I wasn’t there, the service man would have been let in anyway. This made me very uncomfortable as all my travel documents, tablet, and other valuables/personal items were kept in the room. Even if I wasn’t going through back pains, I wouldn’t have felt comfortable having a complete stranger in the room while I wasn’t there. For this, I cannot leave a rating higher than two stars – it’s completely unacceptable by any means to have myself and my personal property exposed when the rental was for the entire place. I expected privacy the entire time.",

It was near midday, the man was never alone in the studio, we took care to disturb as less is possible Ruben, we never touch his personal things. Trying to compensate this I offer for the second time croissants to Ruben for his following breakfast. Meanwhile I saw that Ruben had neck problem and I gave him some medicament to cure that without going in the studio I could not know this. Ruben I think you are a little bit excessive in your comments and conclusion, sometimes in the life in emergency situation you have only one choice, may be you are too young to know that or may be you don't travel enough to give the good price to each problem.

The apartment is 2min from an M7 metro station (direct line to many sights), & amazing that it is on a lovely quiet street that is so near to Gard d'Lest & such close distance to Gard Du Nord.

It was very helpful to have Georges's advice on restaurants to eat at, sights to see , transit etc. Nothing better than a Parisian giving you genuine tourist advice while in Paris. Georges arranged for a friend to welcome us when we arrived who showed us around the apartment. Georges left us some fresh croissants one morning, it was a very pleasant surprise. The apartment is cozy, warm and has all the amenities (Nespresso machine :) ) you would need for a week long stay. The apartment is located near the Saint-martin canal, so it is perfect for a nice walk near the canal. It is close to many good restaurants ( french, Indian, Mexican, middle eastern) and bakeries. The cheese shop Georges recommended was amazing - trust the lady in the store and you will walk away with some great cheese/wine pairings. The apartment is 5 minutes from the metro station, 10-15 minutes from Gare du Nord (this is the station you take from the airport). The metro is super easy to use and gives you access to all parts of the city. Just be sure to have cash to buys tickets. There are pharmacies, ATMs, grocery stores and laundromats within a block. All in all we were charmed by both Georges's hospitality and Paris in general. At the next chance we would stay with Georges again.",

Since it was our honeymoon, on arrival we found a huge bouquet of flowers, champagne and a selection of jams (in addition to all the usual things one might or might not expect, like soap, tea etc.). Also, since Georges couldn't have been there to greet us (we got the keys from a very friendly neighbor), we found a few personal welcoming notes with greetings and information, which was a nice touch. As for the apartment itself, it didn't lack anything. Except for the obvious things, it had a selection of local guides and other books, many TV channels and superhot water. It was clean and easy to arrange for our needs. It's located in the fashionable St. Martin Canal area, full of cafes and restaurants. We usually ate further away but we enjoyed the bakery next door and the cheese shop with its extremely friendly salesperson, who took pains to communicate with us despite our imperfect French. Overall, we enjoyed our stay extremely and found Georges' apartment a wonderful base for our expeditions around the city.",

The studio is very nice, conveniently located and has everything you might want to have in a studio and even more - 100% value for money. Last but not least Georges is a very warmly welcoming host. Would definitely recommend for couples, and would come back myself.",

Georges showed me the great places around the neighborhood, along the canal St-Martin and even les Buttes Chaumont.There is everything you need around the studio, such as boulangerie, fromager, grocery, specialised wine saler and nice little bistro terrasse. It is also close to metro station La Gare de l'Est, where you can reach all the main lines. It's a perfect parisien size studio for a solo traveller or a couple. Even if it's not a big place, you have access to a small fridge, stove, microwave, coffee machine and everything you need to cook a meal. There is a wi-fi connection and a t.v. for rainy days. I've enjoyed taking l'apéro, le déjeuner or even diner with Georges and Jean-Luc. We've had good discussion while enjoying good food and wines. Even if ''redefined\" the concept of Paris plage, I will always keep happy memories of my stay in Studio Charmant du Faubourg St-Martin. Merci Messieurs et à la prochaine.",

We couldn't imagine calmer place in busy Paris. Just close the doors and you are in completely different world. The apartment is also very close to the metro station and less than 10 minutes far from train station Gare du Nord, where the train from CDG Airport stops. What's more, George and Jean Luc left us there things such as delicious marmalade, coca cola for refreshing or wine. In spite of the fact that the flat is quite small, we have no criticism about it. It is luxurious place if you think of the price and two easygoing guys. If we had chance to visit Paris again, we would definitely book it one more time because it's just worth it. P.S. from Míša: Thank you, George, that you made Filip to bring me breakfast in the morning! Nice to meet you.",

            "text": "In over 18 months of travel, Georges and Jean Luc were by far the most friendly, generous, hospitable and warmest hosts we had the pleasure of staying with. They were such a pleasure to stay with and we only wish we could have stayed longer than 5 nights. Georges is genuinely on Airbnb to meet people and to make them feel welcome in his home and his country. Georges and Jean Luc are such amazing hosts that you would think they have been doing it for years, but in fact we were their first guests. Georges came to meet us at the train station, which was very nice, and instantly we felt he was a great person, very genuine and nice to have a conversation with. It was my wife's birthday during our stay and Georges and Jean Luc went out of their way to make the day special for her. We were given lots of privacy but we also really appreciated Georges' fantastic recommendations for dinner and other things to do in Paris. The apartment - which is a separate self-contained apartment nearby Georges' apartment, is stylish, clean, modern, had a functional kitchen and everything else we needed and more - including TV, Wi-fi, very comfortable bed, very hot shower, maps and city brochures, etc etc. It is in a fantastic neighbourhood, with lots of excellent restaurants and bars, and also very close to several metro stops. There is a wonderful, wonderful cheese shop nearby which Georges can recommend, as well as a fantastic bakery. The apartment is very quiet and peaceful despite being near to everything. Above all else it is superb value considering you pay much much more for hotels, without the personal touches and practicality of the apartment - and of course the excellent hosts! Paris is a wonderful city, but for us it was made so much more special because of the unbelievable hospitality shown by Georges and Jean Luc, and because of the lovely apartment. We couldn't have wished for anything better and we are so glad we found Georges and Jean Luc. We will forever remember their generosity and warmth and very much hope one day to stay with them again in Paris, and also perhaps in their other place in the south of France. Look no further than this apartment - you won't regret it! Jean Luc and Georges, you will be forever welcome if you ever visit Australia and we hope we can one day return the hospitality you showed us. Thank you so much again!! Dan and Jessica",

            "text": "Estamos super satisfeitos com os nossos 4 dias hospedados em casa do Georges. Um estúdio, pequenino, mas que para duas pessoas que procuram um local sossegado para descansar, depois de longos dias a passear, tem tudo o que é necessário. De realçar a limpeza e a cama, que apesar de divã, é confortável e bastante espaçosa. Os acessos aos transportes são fáceis, com 2 estações de metro e uma gare, a menos de 5 minutos a pé. Perto do estúdio é possível encontrarmos supermercados para as compras diárias. Imediatamente ao lado, a padaria com os melhores croissants que alguma vez provámos, bem como farmácia, restaurantes etc... O estúdio não está localizado na área mais central de Paris, no entanto, sempre nos sentimos seguros e acima de tudo, longe da confusão citadina pois o mesmo está inserido num pátio cuidado e privado, onde apenas os moradores têm acesso. Finalmente acerca de Georges, o nosso anfitrião, não podíamos estar mais satisfeitos. Desde a chegada até à partida mostrou-se sempre atencioso, prestável e muito simpático. Facilitou sempre o contacto e presenteou-nos com dois magníficos croissants, pain au chocolat, compotas e sumos. Tendo um voo tardio, e não podendo deixar as malas em casa, o próprio Georges cedeu-nos a sua casa para as guardar em segurança, enquanto desfrutávamos do último dia em Paris. Não tendo conseguido ver tudo o que queríamos, mesmo em 5 dias, este seria um local onde com 100% de certezas voltaríamos a ficar. - Very satisfied with our stay in Georges house. A tiny studio but for two persons who search for quiet place to rest, after long days walking for Paris, it is the best. Thumbs up for cleaning and bed quality! 2 near metro stations, less than 5 minutes by walking. Near the studio it's easy to find supermarkets, the best bakery of the street (with the best croissants that you will ever taste), pharmacy, restaurants etc ... Although the studio don't have the must central location, it's located in a very quiet and secure neighborhood, with a private and flowered courtyard. Finally about Georges, we couldn't be more pleased and satisfied. Always kind and helpful, easy contact. Give us croissants, bread with chocolate, jelly and juices. Because of our late flight Georges kept our bags safe while we walk for Paris. For the next time we will choose Georges studio again!",
