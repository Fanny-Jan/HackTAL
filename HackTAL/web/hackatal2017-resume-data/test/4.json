After the second door on the groundfloor, we could use an elevater to the fifth floor. Bruno lives at the right side, the appartment is on the left side. There are no other appartments on the fith floor. On the table, Bruno had given an information folder about shops, restaurants and metro/bus. You can also use citybikes, located in front of the appartment. The appartment was exactly as it was presented on internet. The only point to improve is the opportunity to see other tv-channels. Now, only French channels. In a scale of 1 to 10, I would give 9,5 to the appartment. The street Avenue Parmentier is a perfect start to visit Paris. There are four metrostations within 10 minutes walking. The bus stops in front of the door and available taxis are passing by all the time. All together, we had a great stay. I can recommend Bruno and the appartment highly.",

Bruno is very hospitable and arranged a warm breakfast for us on the day that we arrived (morning) and allowed us to leave our luggage before check-in and after check-out (he lives just next door). What impressed us is also Bruno's love for arts. His home is full of beautiful objects. We all have exhanged contacts with Bruno to keep in touch with him in the future. My professional artist friend already wants to stay in Bruno's unit for one or two months in the future. Recommend anyone who wants to see Paris. If you're into arts, you have to stay here.

Bruno provided all amenities we needed and more, such as a bottle of juice, milk and water to welcome us plus some other snacks, nice thought indeed!

Everyone is so friendly and patient. I only know a handful of French words and I had no problems buying bread, shopping at a nearby deli, and ordering at restaurants. What a wonderful experience.

It is located on the fifth floor, but easily accessible by the small lift, and in a nice part of town, sandwiched between two metros, opposite a supermarket, and close to a bakery and restaurants. The decor is the cherry on top. The place must be used for modelling shoots, it is stunning in its gothic style. At the heart of this review though I really want to thank Bruno for how great he was as a host. Communication was first rate, and we were welcomed with milk and juice and something for breakfast - travelling with my grandmother she really appreciated being able to make a cup of tea as soon as she got in! And he was so kind looking after our luggage while we explored the day of check out. It was a very short visit and his hospitality made all the difference so that we didn't have to waste a second. I have no hesitation in recommending this apartment for a memorable stay in Paris.",

From the detailed and useful description and directions on the Air B&B website, to the very positive interaction with Bruno the owner, to the wonderful cozy and eclectic apartment itself – everything was great. There were snacks, champagne, and coffee awaiting us when we arrived late in the evening. Bruno supplied a wonderful “User Manual” for the apartment which gave us everything we need to know about the apartment, the surrounding area, transportation and restaurant options. He provided tour books and Metro maps. He checked in with us though out the stay to make sure all was OK and graciously allowed us to store our luggage in his own apartment while we toured on our last day. The apartment itself was eclectic and cozy – perfect for us and our two teenagers. The location is very easy access to the Paris Metro (200 meter walk) – which couldn’t be easier to get anywhere in town. Thank you Bruno for your warm hospitality!!!",

The flat lives up to the pictures and is well placed for hopping on the metro and getting around. While it can sleep 6, it may be a bit cosy if you were there for a week and in the flat a lot.

It is so stunning and Bruno and Vanessa have not overlooked a single detail. The decor is elegant, more amenities than any luxury hotel (soaps, linens, hair dryers, fans, irons, coffee maker, tea kettle......) fresh juice, water and snacks were waiting in the cupboard and a lovely note and bottle of wine to enjoy on the balcony at night! A guide with information about the apartment and neighborhood was also provided as well as maps, and books. Our first morning, Vanessa left fresh bread and pastries at our door! I could go on forever about this amazing flat and the incredible Bruno and Vanessa!! By the way, did I mention, this was in Paris?!?! We (my husband two children and I) spent a week in an incredible city that was made even more magical by this incredible \"home\" I just woke up in my own bed back in the USA and already miss coffee on the balcony.

I can not rave about this apartment enough, it exceeded our expectations and then some! You really do feel like you are experiencing an authentic Parisian lifestyle. As described it is truly superb and the apartment is exactly as shown in the photos, anyone looking for a unique and memorable stay while in Paris should look no further. Bruno is a gentleman and deserving of his constant 5 star rating. Even though Bruno and his family live next door it is very private but reassuring to know he is accessible for anything we might need. We loved that the apartment was not in a main tourist area and as such we could enjoy the restaurants and shops visited by locals who we found very welcoming. We could walk a short distance to catch the hop-on-hop-off bus for visiting the tourist sights. As far as apartments go in Paris it was very spacious for our family of 6. We slept on the sofa bed which was extremely comfortable and easy to set up/put down each day. Kitchens & bathrooms are generally small in Paris but there is every imaginable item & gadget you might need here. The lift was a welcome sight for my elderly parents as it is located on the 5th floor but this lends to a lovely balcony where we enjoyed a glass or two of the complementary wine. Thank you Bruno for helping make our stay in Paris so fantastic, just wished we had booked for longer!",

The emailed directions to access the flat were also spot on and easy to follow. His presence on our arrival quickly made us feel at home and familiar with what the unit had to offer. He answered all our questions readily, some by email during our stay and others face-to -face and provided a large range of tourist pamphlets to help plan our visit. He arranged our transport to the airport..a real bonus with the taxi strike still hovering and made the effort to come and help with our departure. The unit was charming and true to the photos provided on airbnb. The tiny balconies added a touch of what we all believe to be truly Parisian....a bonus on a hot night! It was tastefully furnished and completed with fresh flowers, wine and nibbles to help us unwind. We were extremely grateful for the well-stocked, tiny kitchen (groceries not normally provided and utensils) and Its location suited us perfectly. Both the metro(line 11) and bus stop were close by and easy to use to access tourist sites but we found it attractive to be able to walk to Notre Dame under 30 minutes and see the Marais district en route. In 10 minutes, we could also walk to Republic and have access to a wider varieties of shops, cafes and numerous metro lines there. In fact Parmentier Avenue, our street, provided us with plenty of local life in terms of bakeries, supermarket& liquor stores, cafes & bistros, pharmacies & even dress shops. While the location was great, it was noisy when the windows were all opened at night to allow a cool breeze to flow through the apartment. Paris reached 28 to 33 degrees during each day of our visit and we did find the warm weather a trial even though a fan was provided. In a cooler month, this would not have been a problem for us or for people used to hot weather. The layout of the bedrooms probably would suit a family of 4 better than 2 adult couples since 1 bedroom contained 2 single (URL HIDDEN) quite small. However an alternative double bed was provided in the lounge room if we had wanted to use it but we preferred to keep it as a lounge. Overall, we made a great choice with our accomodation for 2 couples sharing and thoroughly enjoyed our stay while playing at being tourists.",

There were so many restaurants and pastry shops around and two metro stops. We were far enough away to feel as if we were living life through the eyes if a Parisian rather than a tourist but close enough to see it all. I would not hesitate to book through Bruno again and again. We will return!",

Appreciate the detailed descriptions such as where to find pillows and where to find maps, books, pillows, outlets for electrics etc. The area is outstanding for anyone who wants to make the most of a visit to Paris. Delightfully quiet during the evening and convenient enough that you can be wherever you need to be inside of 10 minutes. The beds were very comfortable and the apartment, linens and amenities were all very clean and inviting. There were more than enough extras of everything.

Our group is consist of members of different age and we all felt warm hospitality from Bruno and enjoyed our time in Maison 122. The apartment itself was tastefully decorated and very charming. Location wise we had at least three metro stations within walking distance. Eateries and grocery shopping spots around are a handful. We had freshly baked baguettes every morning. Superb convenient location. Bruno prepared a comprehensive folder of everything guests need to know. And in a corner bookshelf we felt like standing in front of tourist info centre, there were all the leaflets and brochure of museums, tours, and all. Bruno helped us with luggage upon greeting us in and out. (There's also a lift in the building so no worries) He helped booking pickup service for us and proactively sent us notice of street blockage due to parade on one day-- all these he went extra miles that one doesn't always expect from their host. I felt lucky coming across with Bruno's listing. Being responsible to book for my big family, one can imagine the pressure of \"what if the flat ends up...\" But Bruno and his flat went beyond my expectation and everyone in the group felt happy.

The main reason for selecting Bruno's apartment was the positive reviews and I am happy to say that we have a pleasant experience during our stay here. This is a nice cute quiet apartment in a good neighborhood. I believe we were the loudest group in the whole building!Although you can sleep 6 people, this apartment is ideal for 4 adults. We are a family of 6 with 4 grown children, so it's a bit cramp with luggages all over and challenging with bathroom logistics. We really appreciate the elevator, we have lots of luggages, and the wifi worked well to upload our photos and keep the children busy. I prefer if the apartment is more lighted but that's maybe more of a personal taste. A final note of reminder for visitors is that museums are closed on Tuesday, we didn't get to bring the children to see the Monalisa. Finally, we like to thank Bruno and Vanessa for their gracious hospitality and we will definitely recommend our friends to come here for their Parisienne experience. Merci et au revoir.",

In our case Bruno really went above and beyond - helping us out enormously when my wallet was stolen to ensure we were safe and provided for. He also has a superb eye in terms of styling the apartment - which is small bit incredibly chic. Every possible amenity has been thoughtfully provided and helps set an intimate and tasteful environment.

We sent him a text and he helped us out with our Eiffel Tower tickets. He's kind and funny and knows how to make people feel right at home. We had an amazing 4 nights in Paris.

Leading up to our stay, Bruno was incredibly helpful and thorough in responding to all our email queries. As our family consists of young children, I wanted to know practicalities about whether there was a supermarket nearby, location of playgrounds, metro stations and just have an overview of the Oberkampf area and Bruno answered all my requests promptly and clearly. During our stay Bruno was always available but never intrusive. The apartment was very clean, very chic and we are grateful for the wine and other goodies Bruno provided upon our arrival. The apartment was beautifully furnished and generously supplied with ample towels and extra blankets. I appreciated the little touches like the provision of slippers and a generous supply of toilet rolls too! The location of the apartment in the Oberkampf area is fantastic too. There are plenty of great restaurants and cafes and the area is well-serviced by a few metro stations. Bruno was more than willing to let us leave our luggage with him on our last day and he was happy to organise a cab for us too. Bruno is completely professional yet strives to make your stay a comfortable homely one.",

The best part is, if we needed anything, he was right there. The apartment itself was nice. This was my first airbnb experience so I was a little nervous, but staying in an apartment ended up being so much better than in a hotel! Originally it was just two of us, but when friends decided to join, we had plenty of room for them. It was nice to have a kitchen and a dining table, and a living room for everyone to hang out in - and the balcony was the best! The balcony with chairs and a table, which was perfect on the warm summer nights. Directly across from the balcony is a school or something, so in the evenings, on the balcony, it feels very private (since no one is across from you).

The weather was perfect whilst we were in Paris, so we used the balcony quite a bit for nibbles and champagne. Public transport access is super easy, and Bruno is very accommodating in providing information (in excellent english, unfortunately our french is negligible) on things to see and how to get there. We also really appreciated his advice on places to visit in the French countryside. In summary we highly recommend Maison 122. The bonus is a wonderful host who welcomed us, and was so helpful when we approached him for advice.",

Bruno provided coffee and a bottle of wine for us. :) Absolutely rate this a 5 out of 5! The flat is on the 5th floor but has an elevator and that was very important for my 4 seniors I had with me. Apartment sleeps 5 to 6 very comfortably. Has a kitchen so you can have meals at the apartment since everything is expensive in Paris for long stays. Thank you Bruno!!! We will be back!!",
