The floor to ceiling french doors bathe the room in light while also providing access to a balcony overlooking classic rooftops, even in the rain it was enjoyable. A sweet surprise from the bathroom and kitchen windows is the eiffel tower in the distance sparkling on the hour each evening. The apartment was perfect for everything I needed and enjoy (loved the generous size shower). It is in close proximity to the Bonne Nouvelle metro station and only a short walk (or one stop) to St. Denis metro where you can connect to almost any station . There are several markets all within walking distance to pick any necessities (and guilty pleasures) as well as plenty of restaurants and cafes (Delaville Cafe, Frenchie To Go , Hoppy for great beers and classic American rock and even a Starbucks around the corner for those without time to sit and enjoy an espresso). Continue from Poissenniere to Montorgueil and you will discover shop after shop providing treats for the palette: bakeries, chocolatiers, fruit markets, charcuterie, cafes. Great apartment and great location. Thank you Thierry for all the details you provided in advance and your quick responses onsite. I had a wonderful stay, in large part due to you great apartment.

The apartment was very spacious and clean. Thierry's housekeeper Bertino met us and arranged for check in. On the first night one of the light globes blew and Bertino fixed it straight away (thanks Bertino!) There was also a baby cot provided for our 1-year old which we greatly appreciated. Lastly, there is a great view of the Eiffel Tower from the kitchen window. If that doesn't sell this apartment to you then I don't know what will!",

He (and a friend who was helping as Thierry was away) were incredibly helpful, as our flight to Paris was very very late but they were happy to meet us even at 11 pm at night at the flat. The flat itself was in a wonderful,spot, so many cafes and eateries close by. The metro station is 2 mins away to get right into the heart of things at the Champs élysées and Notre Dame is a 15-20 min walk away. The beds In the flat were amazingly comfortable, and the sofa bed was the biggest and best I've ever slept on. I would recommend anyone to stay here , it was fabulous.",

The apartment is very easy to find, the tube station is just around the corner and everything is within walking distance. There is a small shop just across the road which has all the essentials and there are several large shops within a 5 minute walk. The apartment is on the 6th floor and there is a balcony to the front of the property where you can admire the traditional Parisian rooftops. The kitchen is small but functional for holiday needs and has a great view of the Eiffel tower. Thierry always responded to emails very promptly and met us upon arrival to show us around - he lives in the same block so is always nearby if there are any problems.

            "text": "Thierry is a very nice and gentle host. Actually this was our first time to book house by Airbnb, and we were keep contacting with Thierry for a lot of questions. Here are some competitive reasons why chose Thierry: 1. Location. His apartment is located on South Montmartre. Subway station “Bonne Nouvelle” is around the corner. Very convenient to all places of interests, by subway or even by foot. My friends and I usually travel on foot due to this perfect location. Walk south for less 30 minutes you can get to Musee du Louvor, River Seine, Le Centre Pompidou, Sainte Chapelle, Cathedrale Notre-Dame de Paris, Musee d’Orsay and so on. As a first time visitor, Paris transportation is so difficult to understand. Maybe it is difficult for everyone, Apple and (SENSITIVE CONTENTS HIDDEN) both don’t provide traffic information for Paris. So I suggest new comers to spend sometime on the routes. 2. Comfortable and Safe. This place is quiet and secured. Nothing could bother you from sleeping during the night. You can stay on balcony for beer or rest on bench. My friends said the bed was soft and nice, and so was the sofa I stayed for 3 nights. The whole building needs 2 step verification to get in so don’t worry about thieves. 3. Decoration. The whole apartment makes us feel good and clean. We even think it’s somehow like a suite room of a hotel. We use kitchen to cook breakfast and wash clothes very easily. 4. Good Owner. Thierry replies us very fast usually, no matter house issues or transport information. His help saved us a lot of time and we all appreciated that. We enjoyed the days in Paris and many many thanks to Thierry. I would choose his apartment when come to Paris again.",

The apartment looked exactly as photo and had all the necessities other than shower gel and shampoo. The washing machine didn't have the drying function but the drying rack helped to do the trick. The lift, although looked antique was functioning well - would be better if it could be bigger though. The place seemed well managed and overall we were really happy with our stay! Thank you Bertino for the detailed introduction to the place! Oh - one more thing - the bookshelves in the apartment had different traveling books and guides that previous travelers left behind and we thought it was very nice of them to do so - so if you book Thierry's place you're probably sorted on guides!

We found the apartment to be quite spacious, clean and really very comfortable. We even braved the balcony in late January to take in the gorgeous view of Parisian rooftops. The lift came in very handy with our heavy suitcases and the location was great. Thierry gave us great advice on how best to get to the places we wanted to visit. As well as some queue dodging tips. His apartment also came complete with a whole lot of guide books which were really useful. We found him to be a great host.",

The Parisian rooftops view creates a great atmosphere. The apartment has been recently renovated so everything is clean and new. Thierry was a very friendly and attentive host. He definitely hope to be back soon.",
