It has a beautiful view down classic Parisian streets, is a few steps from the metro, and a lovely walk to Sacré Coeur, Saint Lazare train station, and lots of restaurants and shops. The other reviewers who say that the shower is small and it's up a lot of stairs -- this is Europe! Lots of places have small showers and no elevators. This was perfectly manageable for us, and we found the place very well outfitted with the amenities we needed. The only complaint I had -- which was NOT the fault of this Airbnb owner -- was that the neighbor smokes, and the smell comes into this apartment a little bit. If you are very sensitive to smoke, then this may not be the place for you. But if you are sensitive to smoke, then Paris may not be the city for you... :) A wonderful stay overall, looking forward to coming back!",

Very nice after a long flight from the US. The room is bright, cozy and clean with a nice view of the street below. Very nice location. You are a 3 minute walk from the metro trains, or you can walk to shopping district in 15 mins or Notre Dame in 25 mins. Given great host and unit, we would definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. Some tips: 1. It is very quiet in the bedroom, which is at the back, but the street noise is higher in the living room which may affect those sleeping on the pull-out sofa if they are light sleepers. I'm a light sleeper and had to move, but my kids had no problem. 2. The shower is quite small: 2 feet by 2 feet floor, so if you're larger, this will likely be an issue. 3. When you first come in from the street level door and must walk up 3 floors, the stairwell is not well maintained (large slabs of peeling paint etc.), but don't let it throw you off. The apartment is very nice!",

The apartment was very clean and had everything I needed. Although the building is quite old and the stairs are a bit hard to climb with luggage, the unit itself is exactly like you see in photos (nicely renovated and bright). I never felt unsafe in the area and it is close to everything you need (grocery, bakery, public transport). I did a lot of walking too! It can be a bit loud with the windows open but overall it was fine. The sofa bed in the living room might be a bit small for 2 people (it slept one person comfortably) and the shower is quite small, but overall I had a great stay and would definitely stay here again when I return to Paris.

PROS: Location – amazing views of the city streets. We felt like we were in the heart of Paris. We were just steps away from awesome restaurants, bars and cool places like the Moulin Rouge. Spacious and clean – The apartment was huge, clean and wonderful. We loved having a separate bedroom on the less busy/noisy side of the apartment facing a quiet courtyard and that the livingroom had big windows with a lot of light and a great view. CONS: Small shower – The shower is VERY small so if you are either bigger or very tall, you wouldn’t like the shower very much. There is also a large step to get in and out of the shower as well. No elevator - For us, it was fine because we are both fit people, but for anyone who has trouble with stairs (3 flights up and they are very narrow, old steps) this apartment may not be the best choice for you. Overall, our stay was amazing and we’d stay here again! 5/5 rating, for sure! Thank you, Welly for your hospitality and for allowing us to stay in your beautiful apartment!",

The location is convenient with a two-line metro station just two blocks away though I ended up walking quite a bit. It was about a 15 minute walk to the Montmarte area and maybe 20 minutes to the Seine. Restaurants, cafes, patisseries, and grocery stores within a block and many more in the surrounding area. There is an organic farmer's market, Marche des Batignolles, on Saturdays from 9:00 to 2:00 which is about five blocks from the flat. There is also a Starbuck's across the street from the metro station. Welly was out of town when I arrived so his nice friend Georges met me at the flat. Welly stopped by a few days later to meet me and spent time answering my questions and showing me a few tricks, like how to change some TV programs from French to English.

It is well-placed to walk to Gare St Lazare for the early train to Vernon (for Monet's house and garden at Giverney). We were welcomed by Welly’s friend who was looking out for us when we missed the entrance door to the building. Welly had confirmed the address with us as 65 Rue de Clichy, not Rue Blanche as listed. He kept in contact with us regarding our expected arrival time. Welly is a concerned host who went out of his way to assist us with a travel query. The front of the apartment overlooks Rue de Clichy, relatively busy at peak times, with a view down the Rue de Vintimille where we found a great restaurant. The bedroom at the back of the apartment is quiet - you may be lucky enough to wake to the homely fragrance of baking bread! A supermarket, greengrocer, good suburban restaurants and excellent patisseries are close by. It was great to be in a residential suburb of Paris yet close enough to the sights of the city. The apartment is on the 3rd floor, without a lift; travelling light, we found this to be no problem. We’d happily return, thanks for everything, Welly.",

We've stayed around Place de Clichy and Batignolles a few times now and have found it to be slightly less touristy, and therefore a welcome relief from the madness that can be Paris as a tourist. It is close to 2-3 metro stations on different lines, so getting to and from major sites is quite easy. Welly wasn't there for check-in, but his friend was really easy to communicate with and showed us how everything works, so we felt comfortable. It is up 3 flights of stairs, which are a bit narrow like many Paris buildings - so people with bad knees/mobility issues should be mindful of that. We were a group of three people (one being my mum), so two of us shared the sofa bed which was one of the comfiest we've slept on! Everything was clean and seemed new, especially the bathroom which is important. The road can be quite noisy when you have the window open, but we found the fan was enough overnight so we could shut the windows and therefore most of the sound. Overall, we had a great 4-night stay in the apartment and would recommend it to anyone.",

The apartment was clean and had all amenities as listed in the description. Important to note that the stairs to the apartment are small and not ideal for large/heavy baggage. There is no elevator. The shower is also very small. If you are a larger/taller person (over 200 lbs), you won't be able to manoeuvre in the shower. The shower is a bit bigger than 2' x 2'. Those are the only 2 points that must be considered when booking. Everything else was fantastic, location is great, very close to the train. It felt very safe in the apartment because of the 3 locks on the door and the key code to get into the building. Although the streets were very busy, the apartment was surprisingly quiet when the front windows were closed. Keep the bedroom window open for a breeze and a fan is provided to keep the place cool. Also note that for Westerners visiting, who are used to ground floor being \"1\", Welly's apartment would be considered 4th floor. This was my first airbnb trip and it was a very positive experience.

But if you head up towards Place de Clichy metro there is a much larger supermarket on the left past a few restaurants. There is also a McDonald's and KFC around the corner. There is a really fantastic bakery on a corner eith a light grey awning with Maison and another word which I have forgotten. For coffee lovers I would recommend the cafe éclair. We got our baguettes here for breakfast and toasted them in Welly's oven. We often walked to the major sights, Lourve, d'Orsay and Notre Dame with no problems. Taking the metro was no issue either. I had hesitations about the area but it was perfectly safe. For those of you who shop, Zara and other high street stores are just around the corner, as well as Galleries Lafayette is not far either.

Also it is located not far from  the Underground Station where two lines are crossed. A very nice madam works at the bakery downstairs. We have tried all kinds of  pastry there. There is a supermarket near the apartment. We were  pleased  much. Welly who is a very hospitable and careful master impressed us favourably.    ",
